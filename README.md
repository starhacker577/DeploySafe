## 📌 Project Overview

DeploySafe is a fully automated **DevSecOps CI/CD pipeline** built as a major academic project for MCA (Cloud Computing & DevOps) at Chandigarh University.

The pipeline integrates **security at every stage** of the software delivery lifecycle — from code quality analysis and dependency scanning to container image vulnerability checks — before deploying a containerized Node.js application locally via Docker.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Jenkins | CI/CD Orchestration |
| Docker | Containerization & Image Registry |
| Docker Hub | Remote Image Storage |
| SonarQube | Static Application Security Testing (SAST) |
| OWASP Dependency Check | Software Composition Analysis (SCA) |
| Trivy | Container Image Vulnerability Scanning |
| Node.js + Express | Application Runtime |
| Discord Webhook | Build Notifications |

---

## 🔒 Security Stages

1. **SonarQube Analysis** — Scans source code for bugs, code smells, and security vulnerabilities. Pipeline fails if quality gate is not passed.
2. **OWASP Dependency Check** — Scans all npm dependencies against the NVD CVE database for known vulnerabilities.
3. **Trivy Image Scan** — Scans the built Docker image for CRITICAL vulnerabilities. Pipeline fails if any are found, blocking deployment.

---

## 🚀 Pipeline Stages

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Checkout Code | Pulls latest code from GitHub |
| SonarQube Analysis | SAST scan + quality gate |
| OWASP Dependency Check | Dependency CVE scan |
| Build Docker Image | Builds container image |
| Push to Docker Hub | Pushes `latest` + versioned `build-N` tags |
| Trivy Security Scan | Image vulnerability check |
| Cleanup Old Test Container | Removes previous test container |
| Run Test Container | Starts app on port 3002 |
| Health Check | Validates `/health` endpoint returns HTTP 200 |
| Stop Test Container | Removes test container |
| Deploy Locally | Runs production container on port 3001 |
| Notifications | Sends build result to Discord |

## 🐳 Docker Hub

Image is automatically pushed to Docker Hub on every successful build:
```
docker pull aakash22sharma/deploysafe-portfolio:latest
docker pull aakash22sharma/deploysafe-portfolio:build-<N>
```
